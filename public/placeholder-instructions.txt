LOGO UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Save the E icon portion (blue/purple gradient square with "E") as:
   /public/e-icon.png

2. Save the "Econic Media" text portion (outline text) as:
   /public/econic-text.png

3. Optionally, save the complete logo (icon + text) as:
   /public/logo.png

For immediate testing, you can:
1. Make a copy of the existing logo.png file and rename it to e-icon.png
2. Create a simple transparent PNG with just text for econic-text.png

Remember to replace these with the actual extracted logo elements when available.

The website has been configured to use these separate logo elements, so once they're saved in the proper locations, the changes will be visible throughout the site.
